HDITA template for Technical Writing at Virginia Tech (Summer 2014)
=================

##Template for Technical Writing HDITA experiment at Virginia Tech

1. Create your github.io repository following the instructions on the [Github Pages site](https://pages.github.com)
2. Download or clone this template (links on the right sidebar of this text)
3. Save the template to your local `username.github.io` repository
2. Update the site's title and information in the `_config.yml` file
3. Open and modify my sample files for tasks, concepts, and references
    * See that I have named the concepts as `c-something.html`, the tasks as `t-something.html`, and the references as `r-something.html`. That makes it easier to tell what information type they follow.
4. Copy the task samples for as many tasks as you need for your project, writing your own content
5. Pay attention to the YAML metadata on every topic, giving it a unique name
6. Save your images, as needed, in the images folder. Give them simple names
7. Update the `topics.yml` file inside the `_data` folder to create your map. Copy for as many topics as needed. Avoid tab spaces
8. Commit your changes to your `username.github.io` repository
9. Enjoy your lovely site in big-screen and mobile devices.
